# dsa

A collection of Python solutions and notes for common Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems.

## Overview

This repository is for my personal practice of DSA and serves as a log and notes of my learning sessions. Here, I document solutions, explanations, and code for various DSA problems, using Python. Many problems are inspired by coding platforms such as GeeksforGeeks and LeetCode.

## Structure

The repository is organized into directories by topic, for example:
- `arrays/` – Array problems, further divided by difficulty (e.g., `easy/`, `medium/`, `hard/`)
- `sorting/` – Sorting algorithm implementations (e.g., merge sort, quick sort, insertion sort, selection sort)
- `hashing/` – Hashing-related problems
- `recursion/` – Recursive problem solutions

Each Python file typically contains a class `Solution` with methods solving the respective problem, references to the original problem statement, and comments on time and space complexity.

## Example Problems

- **Sorting Algorithms:**  
  - Merge Sort  
  - Insertion Sort  
  - Selection Sort  
  - Quick Sort (Lomuto and Hoare partition schemes)

- **Array Problems:**  
  - Check if an array is sorted  
  - Find the largest element in an array  
  - Rotate an array  
  - 3Sum problem  
  - Spiral matrix traversal  
  - Search for an element in an array  
  - Union of two sorted arrays  
  - Rotate a matrix (image)

- **Hashing Problems:**  
  - Frequency of array elements  
  - Find the frequency of a specific element

- **Recursion:**  
  - Reverse sub-array using recursion

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/anujjainbatu/dsa.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired directory and open the Python file for the problem you're interested in.
3. Each file contains a `Solution` class you can import and use, or run directly for experimentation and learning.

## Purpose

- Practice DSA coding problems.
- Log and track my progress and approaches.
- Maintain notes and explanations for future reference.

## Contributing

This repository is primarily for my own learning, but feel free to fork the repo and submit pull requests for new problems, improved solutions, or optimizations.
